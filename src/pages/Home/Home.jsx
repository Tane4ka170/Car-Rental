          throughout the year. Company offers car rental services in key cities
          across Ukraine, with branches situated in Cherkasy, Kherson,
          Chernihiv, Ternopil, Dnipro, Lviv, Vinnytsia, and Lutsk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our car rental services encompass a diverse selection of vehicles
          available for hire, ranging from economical options like the Chevrolet

          website to rent a car, you have the freedom to select a particular
          model rather than being limited to a specific car class.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the Rental Fee for Hiring a Car?</h2>
        <p>The cost of renting a car comprises three key elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The vehicle class: Rates begin at $10 per day for an economy car,
            while premium car rentals start at $100.
          </li>
          <li>
            Duration of the car rental: The longer the rental period, the lower
            the daily cost. Significant savings typically begin with a rental
            period of 4 to 7 days.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deposit requirement: At Car rental, you have the option to rent a
            car without providing a deposit. However, in such cases, there is a
            slight increase in the daily rental cost.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Every rental car is covered comprehensively by both CASCO and MTPL
          insurance, with no consideration of the deductible.
